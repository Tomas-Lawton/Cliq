This project currently won't work because I disabled my AWS account. The main problem with this project is that having a lambda set in this way is way too expensive. 

A chat app based on the interactions of social cliques rather than 1 to 1 individual interactions. You can think of this like Slack, except instead of nested workflows, channels and subgroups, the hierarchy is flat.
